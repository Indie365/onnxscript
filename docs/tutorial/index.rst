Tutorial
========

In this tutorial, we illustrate the features supported by onnxscript using examples.

**Basic Features**

::

    from onnxscript import script
    # We use ONNX opset 15 to define the function below.
    from onnxscript.onnx import opset15 as op

    # We use the script decorator to indicate that the following function is meant
    # to be translated to ONNX.
    @script()
    def Softplus(X):
        return op.Log(op.Exp(X) + 1.0)

In the above example, expressions such as ``op.Log(...)`` and ``op.Exp(...)`` represent
a call to an ONNX operator (and is translated into an ONNX *NodeProto*). Here, ``op``
serves to identify the *opset* containing the called operator. In this example,
we are using the standard ONNX opset version 15 (as identified by the import
statement ``from onnxscript.onnx import opset15 as op``).

Operators such as ``+`` are supported as syntactic shorthand and are mapped to
a corresponding standard ONNX operator (such as ``Add``) in the default opset.

Similarly, constant literals such as ``1.0`` are allowed as syntactic
shorthand (in contexts such as in the above example) and are implicitly promoted
into an ONNX tensor constant.

**Specifying attribute-parameter values**

The example below illustrates how to specify attribute-values in a call.
In this example, we call the ONNX operator ``Shape`` and specify the attribute
values for the attributes ``start`` and ``end``.

::

    @script()
    def FirstDim(X):
        return op.Shape(X, start=0, end=1)

In the translation of a call to an ONNX operator, keyword arguments (aka named arguments)
of Python are translated into attribute parameters (of ONNX), while positional arguments
are translated into normal value-parameters.
Thus, ``X`` is treated as a normal value-parameter (in ONNX) for this particular call, while
``start`` and ``end`` are treated as attribute-parameters.

**Specifying formal attribute parameters of functions**

The (formal) input parameters of Python functions are treated by the converter as representing
either attribute-parameters or input value parameters (of the generated ONNX function).
The converter uses the type annotation on the formal input parameters to make this distinction.
Thus, in the example below, ``alpha`` is treated as an attribute parameter (because of its ``float``
type annotation).

::

    @script()
    def LeakyRelu(X, alpha: float):
        return op.Where(X < 0.0, alpha * X, X)
    
As illustrated in the above example, when an attribute-parameter is used in a context
requiring a value-parameter, the converter will automatically convert the attribute
into a tensor-value. Specifically, in the sub-expression ``alpha * X``, the attribute
parameter ``alpha`` is used as a value-parameter of the call to the ``Mul`` op (denoted
by the ``*``) and is automatically converted.
